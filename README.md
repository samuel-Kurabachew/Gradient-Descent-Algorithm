# Gradient-Descent-Algorithm

This repo contains implementation of basic functions like:
- Activation(sigmoid)
- Prediction formula
- Error function and 
- Function that update weights.

This functions are components of a simple Gradient Descent algorithm.

## Note - Please run using jupyter notebook. :)
